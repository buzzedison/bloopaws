            <h2>1. Program Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The Bloop Referral Program allows participants ("Referrers") to earn commissions by referring new clients ("Referred Clients") to Bloop's services. By participating in the Referral Program, you agree to these Terms and Conditions.
            </p>
            
            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>
              To be eligible to participate in the Referral Program, you must:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be at least 18 years of age</li>
              <li>Have a valid email address</li>
              <li>Comply with these Terms and Conditions</li>
              <li>Not be an employee of Bloop or its affiliates</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>3. Commission Structure</h2>
            <p>
              The Referral Program offers two commission tiers:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Recommend Only:</strong> 5% commission when you refer a client who signs up for our services, without any additional involvement in the sales process.</li>
              <li><strong>Refer & Close:</strong> 15% commission when you refer a client and actively help in the sales process to close the deal.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The determination of whether a referral qualifies for the "Refer & Close" tier is at the sole discretion of Bloop.
            </p>
